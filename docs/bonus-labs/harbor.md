# Install Harbor Image Registry

### Set environment variables
The following section should be added to or exist in your local params.yaml file:

```yaml
harbor:
  harbor-cn: harbor.<shared-cluster domain name>
  notary-cn: notary.<shared-cluster domain name>
```

## Prepare Manifests and Deploy Harbor
Harbor Registry should be installed in the shared services cluster, as it is going to be available to all users.  Prepare and deploy the YAML manifests for the related Harbor K8S objects.  Manifest will be output into `harbor/generated/` in case you want to inspect.

```bash
./harbor/generate-and-apply-harbor-yaml.sh $(yq r $PARAMS_YAML shared-services-cluster.name)
```

## Validation Step
1. All harbor pods are in a running state:
```bash
kubectl get po -n harbor
```
2. Certificate is True and Ingress created:
```bash
kubectl get cert,ing -n harbor
```
3. Open a browser and navigate to https://<$HARBOR_CN>.  The default user is admin and pwd is Harbor12345
```bash
open https://$(yq r $PARAMS_YAML harbor.harbor-cn)
```
